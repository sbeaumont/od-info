# OD Info
Utility app for the OpenDominion game

This is very much a work in progress. I've tried to make it as easy as possible for a non-programmer to install and run this,
but there are still some quirks that I could improve in the future, like not needing to go into
config files to change things.

## Install Python 3

### Windows (direct install)
Go to https://python.org/downloads/ and download the latest release version, install it.

### Mac or Linux (via Homebrew)
To make it work you'll need Python 3 installed. If you have no clue how to do this,
the easiest on Mac is to install the Homebrew package manager (https://brew.sh/#install). 
It tells you to execute this in a Terminal window:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Next step is installing Python3 (also in the Terminal window):

    brew install python3

### Python3 packages
*Note that there's a whole thing about "virtual environments" that is good practice
if you run or develop different Python applications. If this is the only Python
application you're ever planning on running because you're not a leet hacker,
don't bother with it, just continue to the next step: it just means the packages
will be part of the main Python3 installation, which is fine for this case.*

In a terminal window / command prompt you'll need to "pip3 install":

    pip3 install flask requests jinja2 PyYAML bs4 pillow matplotlib

This installs these libraries:

 - flask (webserver)
 - flask-sqlalchemy (database stuff)
 - flask-login (login stuff)
 - wtforms (better forms, now only used for login)
 - requests (pull stuff from the web)
 - jinja2 (template engine for the web interface)
 - PyYAML (to load configuration files)
 - bs4 (Beautiful Soup, to scrape information from webpages)
 - Pillow and matplotlib (for graphs)

### Download files
Download the whole project from here and put it somewhere on your local disk.

### Run and fail: add instance subdir, secret.txt and users.json file
Do a first run: this will always exit with the message that you need to edit the config files.
These files will have been created for you from templates.
 
You will need to edit their contents. For secret.txt:

    username = (your OD username)
    password = (your OD password)
    discord_webhook = (Discord webhook URL, if you have one.)
    current_player_id = (Your player id. Easiest way to find out is go to Search page, hover over your dom name, and note the number at the end of the ".../op-center/<your number>" URL)
    database_name=sqlite:///odinfo-round-<round number>.sqlite
    secret_key=(just some random stuff)
    LOCAL_TIME_SHIFT = (Difference in hours between your local time and OD server time. Positive if your time is ahead of OD server time: e.g. if OD time is 8:21 and your local time is 10:21, you fill in 2 here)

Example:

    username = myODusername
    password = thisisabadpassword123!
    discord_webhook = https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<other stuff>
    current_player_id = 99999
    database_name=sqlite:///my-odinfo-database-for-round-40.sqlite
    secret_key=1234p981(*&^b98g89ubsy89g
    LOCAL_TIME_SHIFT = -2

You can send the networth tracking overview to Discord, but you'll need to set up a
webhook there. On a channel where you can access the settings you can add a webhook
and copy the URL from there.

### One database per round (not for binary version)

Tip: You can change the database_name in secret.txt to a new round number. 
This way you can have a fresh database for every round, and you'll have a copy of the old round's data
if you want to keep it.

### Run application
Run the app locally from the Terminal from the root of the project:

    flask --app flask_app run

For debugging add '--debug' but don't use the debug flag in an unsafe setting!
If you're at home you're safe enough, just don't use it in a Starbucks or a hotel:
you're opening up a local webserver.

Look in the run log for the local URL you can point in your browser, but generally it's localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:5000.

## Usage
If everything is set up correctly you can press on the "update" links on the 
respective pages to pull in new data.

Every time you press "Update" a new timestamped copy is added to the database,
so it depends on you how much history you collect.

The application does NOT do ANY actions itself, or automate collection, since
this is against the rules. You will have to go to the OpenDominion game, perform
your actions there, and then you can use the update links to pull in the latest data.

## Stopping and resetting
You can stop the server by shutting down the Terminal window or pressing Ctrl+C there.

The database "odinfo.sqlite" is created in the folder "instance ". This is just a file:
You can reset the whole application by just renaming, moving or deleting the database file.
As soon as the application sees that there is no database file it will
generate a new one and initialize it.

## Updating reference information

If you're using this app for a while, the reference (.yml) files with facts
about races, tech and wonders might get out of date. You can just download
updated files from the ref-data folder in this project, or go straight to the source 
at https://github.com/OpenDominion/OpenDominion/tree/develop/app/data and
replace them in the ref-data folder.

## Packaging the app to your own architecture

If you also install PyInstaller, 

    pip3 install pyinstaller

you can use

    pyinstaller odinfo.spec

to build an executable that will run on your architecture.
